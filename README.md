# Does a countryâ€™s renewable energy investment impact their air pollution over time?
We will be observing data from different countries through the years 2017-2021 to see if there are any trends between the efforts of converting to various renewable resources and the quality of the air in the area.

# Objectives:
* Storing the data
* MongoDB to store the Data
* Pulled from CSV from Kaggle nd imported into the DB
* Data can be filtered to specific country + years to meet our needs

### OUR APPROACH & PROJECT STEPS

## Data Cleaning Round 1
We used Power Query for the first round of data cleaning, primarily to merge all the files within the datasets. That required multiple query connections and left join merges, first to combine all the renewable data by country, then to blend in the air pollution data by city. We unpivoted columns to account for the multiple entries for each city, matching each city to a country and duplicating the country data for each city. See the Advanced Editor in Power Query for precise steps.
